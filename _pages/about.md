As a first-year Computing Science student at the University of Aberdeen, I bring proficiency in Python and data analytics to the table. I've developed projects like SkopimosMail, a newsletter service, and delved into WordleAnalysis, where I solve Wordle puzzles using Information Theory. 

Alongside my technical skills, my strong communication abilities bolster my collaborative efforts. Looking ahead, I'm eager to leverage data analysis for research, delve into web development, and explore the exciting field of Computer Vision.

## Projects
- [BrandedSchoolUniforms](https://github.com/CodeTheCity/BrandedSchoolUniforms): Helping make school uniforms cheaper in Scotland
- [WordleAnalysis](https://github.com/royhritaban/WordleAnalysis): Sovling wordle with Information Theory
- SkopimosMail: Bespoke newsletter service

## Skills

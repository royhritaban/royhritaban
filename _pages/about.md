I'm a passionate Computing Science student at the University of Aberdeen, currently pursuing a Bachelor's degree with First-Class Honours (97% projected). With experience as a teaching assistant and undergraduate researcher, I have demonstrated strong technical and analytical skills, particularly in Python, data processing, and web development.

My work includes building a web app analyzing school uniform prices across the UK using NextJS, PostgreSQL, and Natural Language Toolkit. I also led a winning team in the Aberway Pathfinding Hackathon, showcasing my problem-solving and leadership abilities.
